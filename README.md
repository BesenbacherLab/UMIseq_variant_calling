# UMIseq_variant_calling
The codes are used for processing deep-targeted UMI-seq data. The workflows are written in gwf and include the steps of both UMI processing and variant calling option of shearwater(both AND & OR algorithm), Mutect2, Varscan2, and DREAMS-vc. We used it for benchmarking different variant callers and UMI processing strategies for detecting low-frequency mutations from cfDNA colorectal cancer patients.
